# Authentication Fixes Report

## Initial Issues
1. Column 'email_adresse' not found - Inconsistent column naming
2. Column 'updated_at' not found - Laravel trying to use timestamps on non-timestamped table
3. SHA1 password hashing not properly implemented

## Solutions Applied
1. Updated User model to:
   - Disable timestamps with `public $timestamps = false`
   - Correctly map database column names
   - Add proper default values via `$attributes`

2. Fixed RegisterController to:
   - Use correct column names in validation
   - Implement proper SHA1 hashing
   - Remove timestamp-related operations


Registration now works correctly with the existing database schema.


# Authentication System Analysis

## Database Structure
- Table: `benutzer`
- Key fields:
  - name
  - email
  - passwort (SHA1 hashed with salt)
  - admin (boolean)
  - anzahlfehler (login attempt counter)
  - anzahlanmeldungen (successful login counter)
  - letzteanmeldung (last login timestamp)
  - letzterfehler (last error timestamp)

## Password Security
- Using SHA1 hashing with salt 'emensa2023'
- Password format: `sha1(password + salt)`
- Admin credentials initialized in p5_password.php

## Registration Process
1. User submits registration form
2. Validation of input fields
3. Password hashing with SHA1 + salt
4. New user record creation with default values:
   - anzahlfehler = 0
   - anzahlanmeldungen = 0
   - admin = FALSE

## Login Flow
1. User submits email and password
2. System:
   - Hashes input password for comparison
   - Verifies credentials
   - Updates login counters and timestamps
   - Creates session for authenticated user

## Security Considerations
1. Basic hash algorithm (SHA1) - could be upgraded to more secure methods
2. Login attempt tracking implemented
3. Separate admin/user privilege system
4. Session-based authentication

## File Locations

### Core Authentication Files
1. Controllers:
   - `/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php` - Handles login logic
   - `/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php` - Manages user registration

2. Models:
   - `/app/Models/User.php` - User model with authentication properties

3. Views:
   - `/resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` - Login form view
   - `/resources/views/auth/register.blade.php` - Registration form view

4. Database:
   - `/database/sql/p5_password.php` - Admin user creation and password hashing
   - `/database/migrations/create_users_table.php` - User table structure

5. Middleware:
   - `/app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php` - Authentication checks
   - `/app/Http/Middleware/RedirectIfAuthenticated.php` - Redirect logic

## Navigation Bar User Display

The user name display in the navigation bar is implemented across several files:

1. View Template:
   - Location: `/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
   - Uses Laravel's @auth directive to check authentication status
   - Retrieves user name from the authenticated session

2. User Data Access:
   - Location: `/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`
   - Stores user data in session upon successful login
   - Updates user login statistics (anzahlanmeldungen, letzteanmeldung)

3. Authentication Logic:
   - Location: `/app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php`
   - Verifies user session before displaying protected content
   - Manages access control for authenticated sections

The navigation bar automatically updates to show the user's name when a valid authentication session exists, hiding it when the user logs out.

## Logging System Implementation

### Logger Configuration
- Location: `/config/logging.php`
- Defines channels and their configurations
- Default channel set to 'stack' which combines multiple channels

### Main Implementation
- Location: `/app/Providers/LogServiceProvider.php`
- Configures Monolog for application-wide logging
- Sets up custom logging channels and formats

### Usage Locations

1. Authentication Logging:
   - Location: `/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`
   - Logs login attempts (successful and failed)
   - Tracks user authentication events

2. Error Logging:
   - Location: `/app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
   - Captures and logs application exceptions
   - Records system errors with stack traces

3. User Activity Logging:
   - Location: `/app/Http/Controllers/FoodController.php`
   - Logs user interactions with meals
   - Records rating submissions

### Key Functions
- Records authentication events
- Tracks user actions
- Monitors system errors
- Stores application performance metrics
- Maintains security audit trails

All logs are stored in `/storage/logs/laravel.log` with the following information:
- Timestamp
- Log level (info, error, warning, etc.)
- User context (if authenticated)
- Event details
- Related data/parameters
